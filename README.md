# Chess AI Project

This is a project (currently in development), where I will make a chess bot to play against.

I am working on a menu system and a simple bot for the next update.

I release beta versions that you can play here:

~~I am also working on a documentation website here:~~ [Discontinued]

This project is made with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), which is a JavaScript library that allows me to draw to the screen without using HTML and CSS.

The only thing that isn't made by me are the pieces and sound effects, which are by CBurnett.
